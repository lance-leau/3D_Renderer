# 3D wire frame renderer
A 3D wireframe is a skeletal representation of any 3D object.
This project was a fun experiment to explore how 3D wireframe renderers worked. I learned how to create and manipulate 3D Vertex Tables, project a 3D object to a 2D screen, and use pygame to develop a user friendly interface


To run the program, either:
- Open and run the ```3D_Renderer.py``` file in the Code folder
- Open a terminal and navigate to the Code folder at ```3D_Renderer\Code``` and enter the command ```python 3D_Renderer.py```

To share your custom shape with a friend:
1) create and save a custom shape in the shape editor
2) a list of number will be printed in the termial
3) copy the list and send it to your friend

To load a custom shape a friend sent you:
1) open a terminal and navigate to the Code folder at ```3D_Renderer\Code```
2) copy the list of number your friend sent you
3) enter the command ```python LoadShape.py ``` and paste the list of number your friend sent you
<br>here is an example of command to load a custom shape:
```
python LoadShape.py 4 10 4 12 4 14 4 16 10 14 10 12 16 12 16 14 16 22 14 22 12 22 10 22
```
