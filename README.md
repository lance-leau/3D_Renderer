# 3D wire frame renderer
A 3D wireframe is a skeletal representation of any 3D object.
This project was a fun experiment to explore how 3D wireframe renderers worked. I learned how to create and manipulate 3D Vertex Tables, project a 3D object to a 2D screen, and use pygame to develop a user friendly interface


To run the program, either:
- Open and run the ```3D_Renderer.py``` file in the Code folder
- Open a terminal and navigate to the Code folder at ```3D_Renderer\Code``` and enter the command ```python 3D_Renderer.py```
